# OAuth 2 Demo client

This application is developed with spring-boot framework.

## Running client application
In order to run this application you need identity provider against which you will be authorized and logged in to the application. First you need to run identity-provider package and then you can run UiApplication.java. Continue to http://localhost:8080 where you will find user interface with login.

## Continous development
If you decide to continue with this project here are same basic steps how to continue:

- Java
    - its very simple to extend the package with custom authorized REST endpoints. Just add you own spring controller and everything should work as expected.
-
    - install bower (most probably will require npm which is part of node.js)
    - after you need nothing more just continue with angular development
